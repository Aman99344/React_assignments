To ignore the `node_modules` folder in all subfolders of your Git repository, you can create a global `.gitignore` file. This file will define patterns that will be applied to all repositories on your machine. Here's how you can set it up:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your home directory: You can go to your home directory by running the following command:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     cd ~
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```
     cd %USERPROFILE%
     ```

3. Create a global `.gitignore` file: Use a text editor to create a file named `.gitignore_global` in your home directory.

4. Open the `.gitignore_global` file and add the following line to ignore the `node_modules` folder:
   ```
   node_modules/
   ```

5. Save the `.gitignore_global` file.

6. Configure Git to use the global `.gitignore` file: Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
   ```

7. Commit the global `.gitignore` file: Run the following command to commit the global `.gitignore` file to your Git configuration:
   ```
   git config --global --add core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
   ```

That's it! The `node_modules` folder in all subfolders of your Git repositories will now be ignored when pushing to GitHub or any other remote repository. This global `.gitignore` file will apply to all repositories on your machine, so you don't have to add a `.gitignore` file to each repository individually.

Note that if you have already added the `node_modules` folder to your Git repository, you'll need to remove it from the repository's history. Removing it from the `.gitignore` file will only prevent future additions.
